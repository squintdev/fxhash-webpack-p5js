FXHASH P5js Generative Token webpack boilerplate
================

This template is based on the fxHash webpack boilerplate, but has p5js implemented. Use sketch.js to create your art. I also added a helpers.js file for some functions I use frequently. Feel free to add your own.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/squintdev/fxhash-webpack-p5js.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the local server
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

### Build Your Token
```sh
npm build
```

This will create a dist-zipped/project.zip file that can be uploaded to fxhash
